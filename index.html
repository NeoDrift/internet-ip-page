    <title>Introduction to Internet Protocols and IP Addressing</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>
    
    <p>
        <b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are standardized rules that enable digital devices such as computers, smartphones, and servers 
        to communicate with each other across a network or the internet. Their primary <b>function</b> is to define how data is formatted, 
        addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. Without these protocols, information could not move between systems reliably or securely.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Some common examples of internet protocols include:
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring web pages over the internet.</li>
            <li><b>HTTPS</b> (HTTP Secure): A secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data during transfer.</li>
            <li><b>FTP</b> (File Transfer Protocol): Allows files to be uploaded and downloaded between computers over a network.</li>
            <li><b>TCP/IP</b> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): The foundational protocol suite for the internet that ensures end-to-end data delivery.</li>
            <li><b>SMTP</b> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending and receiving email messages between servers.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>

    <p>
        An <b>IP address</b> (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol. 
        It works like a digital mailing address, allowing data to reach the correct destination on the internet or within a local network.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are two main versions of IP addresses:
        <ul>
            <li><b>IPv4</b> (Internet Protocol version 4): This version uses a 32-bit address format, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. 
            It looks like this: <b>192.168.0.1</b>. Although widely used, the rapid growth of internet-connected devices has led to shortages of IPv4 addresses.</li>

            <li><b>IPv6</b> (Internet Protocol version 6): Developed to address the limitations of IPv4, this version uses a 128-bit format, 
            supporting about 340 undecillion addresses (that's 340 followed by 36 zeros!). A typical IPv6 address looks like: <b>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</b>. 
            It provides better security, scalability, and performance for modern networks.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Real-world applications</b> of IP addresses include assigning a digital identity to your smartphone when it connects to Wi-Fi, enabling web servers to host websites, 
        and allowing smart home devices to communicate with each other. IPv6 is now being increasingly adopted in modern infrastructure to ensure long-term growth.
